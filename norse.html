            <h2>Born a Monster</h2>
            <p>Medusa was born a daughter to the sea gods Ceto and Phorcys. 
                Anyone who looked into her eyes turned to stone and she 
                was known to be the most feared Gorgon.</p>
            <p>She was often depicted with snakes for hair and wings protruding
                from her back.</p>
            <p>She was feared all her life and died by the hands of Perseus, a
                 child fo Zeus. Although, he wasn't alone in his conquest. Several 
                 other gods helped track her down and behead her.</p>
            <p>Even after death, she was seen as a monster. Perseus paraded 
                around her head as a weapon and turned his enemies to stone. 
                Lastly, her head was gifted to Athena who incorporated it into her 
                battle armor.</p>
            <p>If you haven't already, go read the Greek story and see how Athena
                is involved in that rendition too!</p>

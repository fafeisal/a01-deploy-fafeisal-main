            <h2>Cursed to be a Monster</h2>
            <p>Medusa wasn't always a Gorgon that turned people to stone with 
                a single glance. In fact, she was once a gorgeous mortal and served 
                as a priestess under Athena, one of three virgin goddesses. She 
                likewise vowed to remain a virgin to honor the goddess she served. </p>
            <p>Like many others, Poseidon grew infactuated with her beauty, however, 
                like she did with all others, Medusa rejected his advances. Tragedy struck 
                one day, when Poseidon wntered the temple and brutally raped her on 
                Athena's altar. </p>
            <p>When Athena heard, she became enraged. Rather than concerned 
                for her priestess, she was angry at Poseidon for defiling her temple. 
                But she couldn't take her anger out on such a high ranking God, and instead
                she decided to strip Medusa of her beauty wit a curse. She turns her into 
                a gorgon, a creature with a head of snakes and the body of a serpent.</p>
            <p>From then on, Medusa lived a bitter life, hating all men and turning them 
                to stone. Eventually, Perseus beheads her with advice from Athena, and he gifts
                the head to the goddess. Athena places it atop her shield to turn her enemies 
                in battle to stone. </p>
            <p>Thus Medusa suffers a tragic end because of Poseidon's desires and Athena's betrayal.</p>
            <p>If you haven't already, go read the Norse story and see how Athena
                is involved in that rendition too!</p>
